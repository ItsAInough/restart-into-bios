# restart-into-bios
A simple cmd command that lets you restart windows, so that it reboots into the BIOS/UEFI

This is a very basic script that helps alot with windows 11 to boot into the BIOS/UEFI.
Recommended use:
- Download the files into a folder of your choice.
- Make a shortcut to the restart-into-bios.bat file and save it to your desktop.
- Change the icon of the shortcut to the very lovely and handcrafted bios-pixel.ico file.
- Double click the icon.
